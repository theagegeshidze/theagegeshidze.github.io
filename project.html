        <h3> Nuclear Power v Renewables: Is there space for nuclear power in the fight against climate change?  </h3>
        
        <p> Aim:
        Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing our world today, and finding ways to reduce
        our carbon emissions and protect the planet for future generations is more important than ever. One potential
        solution that has been proposed is the use of nuclear power as a low-carbon source of electricity. However, 
        the role of nuclear power in the fight against climate change is a topic of ongoing debate, with both supporters
        and critics raising valid points. Climate activists tend to agree that renewables will play an important role, but
        the role of nuclear power remains contentious. By comparing the relative; safety, capacity, inertia, cost, 
        stability and possibility of the two options, we aim to explore whether there is space for nuclear power in our 
        fight against the climate crisis. </p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        
        <p>Background: First, letâ€™s explore some graphs to set the global scene in terms of fossil fuel dependence and carbon emissions.
        We can see from our first trellis graph, how much the top 6 global economies rely on carbon intensive energy sources such as coal. </p>
        
        <div class="chart" id="chart32"> </div>
        <div class="chart" id="chart33"> </div>


        <p> In order to explore the impact, another necessary graph is the C02 emissions globally.
        I chose to represent this using a choropleth. I used information from ourworldindata.org/co2emissions. 
        The data was cleaned and put into a TIDY format in Python. Notably, we see harsh increases in Carbon Dioxide emissions, 
        and no notable drops in any areas from any policy or climate activism. With some inference, our chart reveals two things:
        a) carbon emissions are continuing to grow and no efforts currently have had a big impact on emissions and b) the very 
        composition of who is polluting the most has changed from Europe and the US in 1950, but now we are seeing notable increases
        in Asia, specifically China. Considering the changing economic climate, with much of production being outsourced to Asia, 
        this makes sense; and should inform where policy recommendations are concentrated.</p>
