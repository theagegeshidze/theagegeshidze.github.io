        <h3> Nuclear Power v Renewables: Is there space for nuclear power in the fight against climate change?  </h3>
     
     <h3> Aim </h3>
        <p>  
         Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing our world today, and finding ways to reduce our carbon emissions
         and protect the planet for future generations is more important than ever. 

         One potential solution that has been proposed is the use of nuclear power as a low-carbon source of electricity, another the use
         of renewables such as hydropower, solar power or wind. This project aims to explore which approach is better. 
         </p>

 <div class="Background">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        
        <p>First, let’s set the scene.

         In order to explore the impact, another necessary graph is CO2 emissions per capita on a global scale. I used information
         from the CO2 emissions section from ourworldindata.org. The data was cleaned and put into a TIDY format in Python. We can
         also see from our pie chart just how dependent we are on coal for electricity production on a global scale.

         It is evident that we can not continue with the status quo.So which path should we go down: nuclear power or renewables?
         We will be using the following metrics to compare the two pathways: safety, emissions, capacity, stability, time and cost.

        </p>
        
        <div class="chart" id="chart35"> </div>
     
     </div>
     
  <div class="Safety">
        <h3>Safety</h3>
        
        <p>Nuclear power is often considered unsafe due to largely well known disasters such as Fukushima or Chernobyl. 

        However, evidence suggests that this fear is generally unwarranted, especially when compared to how unsafe our 
        current main source of energy is (fossil fuels). 

        We demonstrate this by looking at the rates of death associated with each source of energy. Both nuclear and 
        renewables are much safer alternatives than the status quo. The data was extracted from ourworldindata.org and tidied up in Python.

        Safety is not a concern when comparing nuclear power and renewables.

  <div class="Carbon Emissions">
        <h3>Carbon Emissions</h3>
        
        <p>We can see that both options are low in carbon emissions, with XYZ pulling just ahead. 

        It is important to note that we looked over these emissions in the long run using lifecycle emissions. In the short run, 
        nuclear power has a major downside; plants are incredibly carbon intensive to build. Over time these emissions are made up 
        for due to the ultra low carbon emissions post commission and economies of scale. 

        Setting up and building renewables will also, of course, be to an extent carbon intensive; but it is much smaller than setting
        up nuclear power reactors. Looking at our graph, we can see that all of them are remarkably better than coal.
        <div class="chart" id="chart34"> </div> 
        </p>
      <h3>Cost</h3>
        <p> Cost is another important factor, and for many policy makers it is the most important factor. Nuclear reactors cost billions.
        Even considering some complex infrastructure for renewables, nuclear power is considerably more expensive to implement.

        Sourcing power 100% from nuclear, is economically not feasible and this may create a compelling argument for 100% renewables. There 
        is also evidence that solar in particular is decreasing in price rapidly (/all renewables) supporting the case. 

        Mention specifically solar with a drop down thingy.
            
        However, research suggests that overall all the cheapest solutions do include nuclear. This is XYZ and the suggestions are... 
        As suggested in this Chicago study, it makes sense to use renewables up until their sweet spot and use nuclear to supplement the gap.

      </div>
       
 <div class="Capacity">
        <h3>Capacity</h3>
        
        <p>The main challenge with regards to capacity is that renewables require much more space than nuclear power. Nuclear power uses a lot 
        of existing infrastructure, whilst new grid interconnectors would need to be built for renewables to reach some areas.
 
        On the other hand, nuclear power would struggle with being able to reach rural areas or areas with low population density, a challenge that
        renewables would tackle with ease. 

        In theory, both are capable of replacing fossil fuels, but not without research, development and inevitable challenges.

        </p>
     <div class="chart" id="chart36"> </div>
     </div>
     
   <div class="Stability">
        <h3>Stability</h3>
        
        <p>One of the most important challenges, and criticisms of renewables is stability. A well known statement is that the “sun doesn’t always
        shine and the wind doesn’t always blow”, and this is true. In order to have a renewable dependent system, we would need a lot of storage to
        make up for these gaps in production, which takes up a lot of space. 

        Storage and hybridisation also requires very expensive infrastructure. Whilst renewables are variable, nuclear power is much more stable and
        will have no trouble supplying constant power. Nuclear provides considerably more stability.

   <div class="Conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>Team Nuclear v Team Renewables should not be the debate, suggesting we go 100% either is complicated and unnecessary. Both ‘camps’ have pros
        and cons. Renewables are cheap to build, quick to build and allow for rural electrification, however it needs a lot of infrastructure that currently
        doesn’t exist and lacks stability (due to its inherent variability). Nuclear on the other hand fills the gap and allows for great stability, and is 
        also cheap in the long run but it is excessively expensive and slow to build; with the average reactor taking 108 months to build, and the climate crisis 
        looming, nuclear is hardly the silver bullet. 

        So, is nuclear the only solution? No. Is relying entirely on renewables the solution? No.  But, is nuclear power a useful tool to help lower our carbon
        emissions in a future hybrid grid which is primarily made up of advancing renewables such as solar or wind? Yes.

        At the end of the day, time is running out. We just need to get on with it. Trying to aim for 100% nuclear or renewable energy may be possible but it will
        be excessively difficult. The best approach is to combine the two, and allow each source to balance the shortcomings of the other; with nuclear bringing the
        stability renewables lack, and renewables providing the fast and inexpensive solutions we need to deal with the climate crisis quickly and effectively.
